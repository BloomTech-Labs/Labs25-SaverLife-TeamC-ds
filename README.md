## Project Overview

SaverLife (formerly EARN) is a nonprofit on a mission â€” to inspire, inform, and reward the millions of Americans who need help saving money. Through engaging technologies and strategic partnerships, they give working people the methods and motivation to take control of their financial future.

Money is hard to manage. How can we properly predict our budget and our upcoming expense? We will create an application that takes a user's past financial data and creates a predicted budget.

Here's a quick video presentation to get you started: https://youtu.be/VTn3yK6lOGk
